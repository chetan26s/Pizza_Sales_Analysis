# Pizza_Sales

Introduction

I embarked on a journey to explore the world of pizza sales data with a primary goal: to uncover valuable insights and make data-driven decisions to drive business growth. The Problem I Aimed to Solve Our pizza business had been thriving, but we needed a deeper understanding of our sales data to sustain and enhance our growth. My analysis aimed to address the following questions:

What was our total Revenue over a specific period? How many pizzas have we sold in total? What was the average order amount? Which pizza names were the most and least popular by order? Which pizza names had the highest and lowest quantity sold? Which pizza sizes were most preferred by our customers? Which pizza categories generated the most sales? What were the daily and monthly sales trends? How did sales vary across pizza categories and sizes?
